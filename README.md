A high-difficulty 3D arcade game built in Unity, inspired by the mechanics of The World's Hardest Game and classic endless runners. The objective is deceptively simple: guide a physics-based ball to the goal while collecting coins. However, the catch is strict collision detection—touching any wall or obstacle results in an immediate level restart.
